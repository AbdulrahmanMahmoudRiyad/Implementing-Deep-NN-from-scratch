# MNIST Dataset Deep Learning Model using Pandas and NumPy
Building DL model from scratch in python

## Overview

This project implements a deep learning model for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using only Pandas and NumPy, excluding common deep learning libraries. The project includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Load the MNIST dataset, preprocess the data, and split it into training and testing sets using Pandas and NumPy.

2. **Model Implementation:** Implement a deep learning model using custom classes for linear layers and activation functions (ReLU) without relying on external libraries.

3. **Training Loop:** Develop a training loop with minibatch gradient descent and parameter updates. Monitor training progress by logging accuracy and loss metrics periodically.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance on a validation set and test set. Compute accuracy metrics and visualize results.
